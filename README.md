# stack-resolvers

Custom Haskell package sets for Stack

## Usage

Replace your `resolver` in`stack.yaml` with a raw URL here. If caching is frustrating you, put it in quotes with a "#x" at the end! Example:

    resolver: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ejconlon/stack-resolvers/master/head.yaml#0"

## Resolvers

* [head](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ejconlon/stack-resolvers/master/head.yaml) - A recent LTS with some in-progress packages
